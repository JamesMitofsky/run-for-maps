        <p>
          The authentication approach taken by ROSM is different from most apps. You can think of
          ROSM as a wrapper around the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform. For example, if you were to
          mark a fountain as <em>out of order</em>, ROSM formats that information and immediately
          submits it to OSM. In this way, ROSM retains no information about the people who use
          it—your authentication is completely local to your device, and it creates a portal for you
          to interact with OSM.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wanted to see the complete history of updates you submitted to OSM, you would want
          to look at{" "}

            your OSM account
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          All this is to say: you need to create an account through OSM instead of ROSM because OSM
          is the place your information really lives. The only thing ROSM does is facilitate a very
          specific type of data manipulation. Because the UI for OSM is meant to support updating
          information about buildings and roads and businesses and countries, it needs to take a
          pretty general approach to the design. ROSM simplifies the many clicks it would take to
          update a fountain into just a few, and then it ships that information off to OSM to be
          safely recorded for public use.
