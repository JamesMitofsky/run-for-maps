# @rosm/core

Platform-agnostic logic shared by [`@rosm/web`](../../apps/web) and
[`@rosm/mobile`](../../apps/mobile): GPS/distance math, the orienteering route
planner, BRouter turn extraction, Zod schemas, the Zustand stores (run / planner /
outbox), the route archive, and the live-run guidance. Nothing here touches a
browser, Capacitor, or Expo API directly.

## Ports

Anything platform-specific (network, key/value storage, the offline outbox store,
geolocation) is an injected **port**. Each app wires its adapters once at startup:

```ts
import { configureCore } from "@rosm/core/configure";
configureCore({ api, kv, outboxStorage, geolocation });
```

Core code reads them lazily via `corePorts()` (throws if unconfigured). Port
interfaces — plus contract-only ports the apps implement in their own UI layer
(haptics, notify, share, keep-awake, live activity, confetti) — live in
[`src/ports.ts`](./src/ports.ts).

## No build step

This is a "just-in-time" internal package: it ships TypeScript **source** via
subpath exports (`@rosm/core/geo`, `@rosm/core/stores/run`, `@rosm/core/schemas`, …).
Next compiles it through `transpilePackages`; Metro compiles it natively. `zod` and
`zustand` are peer dependencies so there is exactly one shared instance per app.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm --filter @rosm/core test        # vitest, node environment
```

Store/archive tests inject in-memory fake ports (see `tests/helpers/ports.ts`) rather
than mocking modules.
